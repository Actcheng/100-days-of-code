# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 001: January 04, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Watched videos of the first week of Sequence Model. Started Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Completed first section: Basic HTML and HTML5. Started a bit of the next section.

**Thoughts:** First day on freecodecamp. Still struggling if I should learn Front End Libraries Certification directly. But it seems that I have forgotten all the basics about HTML. Excited to learn about Google Font.
