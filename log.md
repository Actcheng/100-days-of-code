### Day 011: January 14, 2019

### Day 010: January 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Personal Profolio Webpage and earned my first certificate in #freecodecamp! Also completed 22 challenges in Basic JS.

**Thoughts:** Thought that I need to spend much time to make the CSS grid, but it turned out to be quite easy. Can't believe I can earn the certificate in just 10 days. I have learnt HTML long ago, and thought that I should skip this. Fortunately I didn't skip it. Have learnt much about CSS from this certification, and I can't imagine that I can build five small projects in just 10 days. Looking forward to learn more in the next cerfication.

### Day 009: January 12, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on Personal Profolio Webpage for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. (10/12 tests passed) Also started playing with Basic JavaScript on freecodecamp at my lunchtime (50 challenges completed). 

**Thoughts:** Most of the requirements for the webpage are similar to the previous projects. Want to make use of CSS Grid to make the profolio although it is beyond the requirements. The basic JS syntax is quite similar to Python.

### Day 008: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Technical Documentation Page for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. 

**Thoughts:** So happy to make a left side navbar. Used the content for python standard library. A bit waste of time to copy and paste the documentation content and put the p and code wrappings by hand.

### Day 007: January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress:**  Completed the product landing page and started working on Technical Documentation Page for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Got 7/16 tests passed.  

**Thoughts:** Took me some time to realize that "name" attribute is essential for form submission. Should never miss this anymore.

### Day 006: January 09, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on the product landing page for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Got 14/16 tests passed.  

**Thoughts:** The nav-bar took me quite a lot of time to fix. I started to write the css script for each element I add to the page, instead of writing them after getting all the elements.

### Day 005: January 08, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Made a survey form for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp! 

**Thoughts:** This challenge helped me understanding the forms. I didn't notice the difference between "name" and "value" before. The hardest thing is not passing the tests, but to make the survey forms look nice. The HTML of the sample page taught me a lot.

### Day 004: January 07, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I made a tribute page for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp! 

**Thoughts:** Didn't know that life becomes much easier with CodePen! Challenge completed within an hour. Tried a few CSS options to make the page more delicate, but it is quite hard to design a nice page in a really short time.

### Day 003: January 06, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design, CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid challenges of Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. In total 65 challenges completed.

**Thoughts:** "Applied Accessibility" is quite boring. Media query seems convenient to be used. There are quite a lot to remember for CSS flexbox and grid. CSS grid seems to be widely used in many websites! Will start doing my first web project tomorrow!

### Day 002: January 05, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Still on Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Completed Basic CSS and Applied Visual Design. In total 88 challenges completed.

**Thoughts:** First time to work on CSS. Didn't know that it is so powerful! Can make simple shapes and animations with simple codes. Good that I didn't skip this certification. I knew fewer than what I expected.

### Day 001: January 04, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Watched videos of the first week of Sequence Model. Started Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Completed first section: Basic HTML and HTML5. Started a bit of the next section. Completed 35 challenges.

**Thoughts:** First day on freecodecamp. Still struggling if I should learn Front End Libraries Certification directly. But it seems that I have forgotten all the basics about HTML. Excited to learn about Google Font.
