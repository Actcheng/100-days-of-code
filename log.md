# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Freecodecamp challenges completed:** 193 / 1409

### Day 008: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the  Technical Documentation Page for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. 

**Thoughts:** So happy to make a left side navbar. A bit waste of time to copy and paste the documentation content and put <p><code> etc.

### Day 007: January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress:**  Completed the product landing page and started working on Technical Documentation Page for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Got 7/16 tests passed.  

**Thoughts:** Took me some time to realize that "name" attribute is essential for form submission. Should never miss this anymore.

### Day 006: January 09, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on the product landing page for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Got 14/16 tests passed.  

**Thoughts:** The nav-bar took me quite a lot of time to fix. I started to write the css script for each element I add to the page, instead of writing them after getting all the elements.

### Day 005: January 08, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Made a survey form for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp! 

**Thoughts:** This challenge helped me understanding the forms. I didn't notice the difference between "name" and "value" before. The hardest thing is not passing the tests, but to make the survey forms look nice. The HTML of the sample page taught me a lot.

### Day 004: January 07, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I made a tribute page for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp! 

**Thoughts:** Didn't know that life becomes much easier with CodePen! Challenge completed within an hour. Tried a few CSS options to make the page more delicate, but it is quite hard to design a nice page in a really short time.

### Day 003: January 06, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design, CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid challenges of Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. In total 65 challenges completed.

**Thoughts:** "Applied Accessibility" is quite boring. Media query seems convenient to be used. There are quite a lot to remember for CSS flexbox and grid. CSS grid seems to be widely used in many websites! Will start doing my first web project tomorrow!

### Day 002: January 05, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Still on Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Completed Basic CSS and Applied Visual Design. In total 88 challenges completed.

**Thoughts:** First time to work on CSS. Didn't know that it is so powerful! Can make simple shapes and animations with simple codes. Good that I didn't skip this certification. I knew fewer than what I expected.

### Day 001: January 04, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Watched videos of the first week of Sequence Model. Started Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Completed first section: Basic HTML and HTML5. Started a bit of the next section. Completed 35 challenges.

**Thoughts:** First day on freecodecamp. Still struggling if I should learn Front End Libraries Certification directly. But it seems that I have forgotten all the basics about HTML. Excited to learn about Google Font.
