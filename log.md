# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Freecodecamp challenges completed:** 188 / 1409

### Day 003: January 06, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design, CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid challenges of Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. In total 65 challenges completed.

**Thoughts:** "Applied Accessibility" is quite boring. Media query seems convenient to be used. There are quite a lot to remember for CSS flexbox and grid. CSS grid seems to be widely used in many websites!

### Day 002: January 05, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Still on Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Completed Basic CSS and Applied Visual Design. In total 88 challenges completed.

**Thoughts:** First time to work on CSS. Didn't know that it is so powerful! Can make simple shapes and animations with simple codes. Good that I didn't skip this certification. I knew fewer than what I expected.

### Day 001: January 04, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Watched videos of the first week of Sequence Model. Started Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Completed first section: Basic HTML and HTML5. Started a bit of the next section. Completed 35 challenges.

**Thoughts:** First day on freecodecamp. Still struggling if I should learn Front End Libraries Certification directly. But it seems that I have forgotten all the basics about HTML. Excited to learn about Google Font.
