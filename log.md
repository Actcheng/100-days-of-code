### Day 081: March 26, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on issue tracker: completed post, delete and put. (2 hrs)

**Thoughts:** Got stuck because of not understanding Mongo: 

1. Finding by ID - ObjectId(id) should be used instead of id

1. The returned object of .find() is a mess. Use .find().toArray() instead

### Day 080: March 25, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed on Metric-Imperial Converter. Created the tests and got all passed.

**Thoughts:** First time creating my own tests using Chai. The protection part is easy - just use helmet! I am thinking of creating a project which combine all these FCC mini projects into a big project as a showcase...

### Day 032: February 4, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Spent two hours to make a Random Quote Machine for Front End Libraries Certification on #freecodecamp. Watched a video of how to combine HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Day 031: February 3, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Set up a repo for projects as github pages. Installed node.js and trying to set up the environment of developing React app on GitHub pages.

**Thoughts:** A bit suprised that I can hold unlimited projects on gh-pages. Quite time consuming to set up the environment before really working on the scripts, but I think I can learn more than using codepen.

### Day 030: February 2, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished on React and Redux for Front End Libraries Certification on #freecodecamp. 6 FCC challenges completed. 

**Thoughts:** Will start my first project with JS tommorow, but I am not sure how I should do it. Do other people work on the project on CodePen or using other tools? I feel that it would be better if I can learn how to set up React/Redux instead of using codepen.

### Day 015: January 18, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed Object Oriented Programming for Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on #freecodecamp. Started Functional Programming. 33 challenges done.

**Thoughts:**  Thought I was familiar with OOP but turned out there were something new to learn. I wish I had learnt about functional programming before, so my code would not be in such a mess...

### Day 014: January 17, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed Basic Data Structure and Basic Algorithm Scripting for Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on #freecodecamp. 27 challenges done.

**Thoughts:**  Both are quite easy, but helped me to get familiar with the syntax. The last few challenges need some thinking though.

### Day 011: January 14, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Basic JavaSctipt for Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification on #freecodecamp. 36 challenges done.

**Thoughts:** A very long section for refreshing the concepts for basic JS.

### Day 010: January 13, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Personal Profolio Webpage and earned my first certificate in #freecodecamp! Also completed 22 challenges in Basic JS.

**Thoughts:** Thought that I need to spend much time to make the CSS grid, but it turned out to be quite easy. Can't believe I can earn the certificate in just 10 days. I have learnt HTML long ago, and thought that I should skip this. Fortunately I didn't skip it. Have learnt much about CSS from this certification, and I can't imagine that I can build five small projects in just 10 days. Looking forward to learn more in the next cerfication.

### Day 009: January 12, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on Personal Profolio Webpage for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. (10/12 tests passed) Also started playing with Basic JavaScript on freecodecamp at my lunchtime (50 challenges completed). 

**Thoughts:** Most of the requirements for the webpage are similar to the previous projects. Want to make use of CSS Grid to make the profolio although it is beyond the requirements. The basic JS syntax is quite similar to Python.

### Day 008: January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Technical Documentation Page for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. 

**Thoughts:** So happy to make a left side navbar. Used the content for python standard library. A bit waste of time to copy and paste the documentation content and put the p and code wrappings by hand.

### Day 007: January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress:**  Completed the product landing page and started working on Technical Documentation Page for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Got 7/16 tests passed.  

**Thoughts:** Took me some time to realize that "name" attribute is essential for form submission. Should never miss this anymore.

### Day 006: January 09, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Working on the product landing page for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Got 14/16 tests passed.  

**Thoughts:** The nav-bar took me quite a lot of time to fix. I started to write the css script for each element I add to the page, instead of writing them after getting all the elements.

### Day 005: January 08, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Made a survey form for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp! 

**Thoughts:** This challenge helped me understanding the forms. I didn't notice the difference between "name" and "value" before. The hardest thing is not passing the tests, but to make the survey forms look nice. The HTML of the sample page taught me a lot.

### Day 004: January 07, 2019

**Today's Progress:** I made a tribute page for Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp! 

**Thoughts:** Didn't know that life becomes much easier with CodePen! Challenge completed within an hour. Tried a few CSS options to make the page more delicate, but it is quite hard to design a nice page in a really short time.

### Day 003: January 06, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Finished Applied Accessibility, Responsive Web Design, CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid challenges of Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. In total 65 challenges completed.

**Thoughts:** "Applied Accessibility" is quite boring. Media query seems convenient to be used. There are quite a lot to remember for CSS flexbox and grid. CSS grid seems to be widely used in many websites! Will start doing my first web project tomorrow!

### Day 002: January 05, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Still on Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Completed Basic CSS and Applied Visual Design. In total 88 challenges completed.

**Thoughts:** First time to work on CSS. Didn't know that it is so powerful! Can make simple shapes and animations with simple codes. Good that I didn't skip this certification. I knew fewer than what I expected.

### Day 001: January 04, 2019

**Today's Progress:** Watched videos of the first week of Sequence Model. Started Responsive Web Design Certification on #freecodecamp. Completed first section: Basic HTML and HTML5. Started a bit of the next section. Completed 35 challenges.

**Thoughts:** First day on freecodecamp. Still struggling if I should learn Front End Libraries Certification directly. But it seems that I have forgotten all the basics about HTML. Excited to learn about Google Font.
