### R2D28: 22 Sep, 2019
Leetcode contest; Gatsby tutorial: new static pages can be generated so easily! 
Found a new tutorial video on Data Structures offered by freeCodecamp, quite long (8 hrs!) but seems to include all the essential!

### R2D27: 21 Sep, 2019
Learning about Hash Set and Hash Map. Tutorial on Gatsby.js

### R2D26: 20 Sep, 2019
Random coding questions. I think I should go back to some projects instead...Maybe just half hour for coding exercises per day (2 hr)

### R2D25: 19 Sep, 2019
Random coding questions (1.5 hr)

### R2D24: 18 Sep, 2019
Random coding questions, 100 problems solved (1 hr)

### R2D23: 17 Sep, 2019
Random coding questions (1 hr)

### R2D22: 16 Sep, 2019
Only have time for some random coding questions (1 hr)

### R2D21: 15 Sep, 2019
Leetcode contest. Exercies on tries application. (2 hr)

### R2D20: 14 Sep, 2019
Coding excercies. Learning about BSt, N-ary trees and tries. (2 hr)

### R2D19: 13 Sep, 2019
Coding exercises. Wondering how to start creating my own site, so I started with writing "user stories"  (1.5 hr)

### R2D18: 12 Sep, 2019
Did some coding exercises and started building my personal website. Almost forgotten how to write CSS and JS. 
Is it too much to use React to build a personal page? (1.5 hr)

### R2D17: 11 Sep, 2019
Still on BST. Wanted to work a bit on Kaggle competitions but I am feeling headache... (1 hr)

### R2D16: 10 Sep, 2019
Did coding exercises and learnt about binary search tree. Leetcode is so time-killing, so should I move on to projects instead? Still I also learnt a lot from the exercies, so it is a hard decision... (2.5 hr)

### R2D15: 9 Sep, 2019
Learning about binary search tree and DFS/BFS. Feeling more confident in writing recursive functions.
Reading about Autoregressive models (AR/MA/ARMA/ARIMA)

Reference: 
[DFS and BFS](https://eddmann.com/posts/depth-first-search-and-breadth-first-search-in-python/)

[Time Series (Advanced ML lecture)](http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~milos/courses/cs3750/lectures/class16.pdf)

### R2D14: 8 Sep, 2019
First time participating in Leetcode contest and it is quite interesting. Also continued learning binary tree. (4 hr)

### R2D13: 7 Sep, 2019
Learning about time series analysis in Python. I think I should start to train my own model. 
And daily Leetcode challenges! (2 hr)

### R2D12: 6 Sep, 2019
Still on problems about binary tree. Not sure about how to implement and use DFS and BFS. Also looking at time series basics for a Kaggle competition. (3 hr)

References: [Time series basics](https://www.kaggle.com/jagangupta/time-series-basics-exploring-traditional-ts)

### R2D11: 5 Sep, 2019
Worked on some problems about binary tree. It takes me much time to write clean code with recursion (1.5 hr)

### R2D10: 4 Sep, 2019
Decided to spend time to learn basic data structures and algorithms, so I started about Binary Tree on Leetcode Explore. (2 hr)

References: [Binary tree](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/)

### R2D9: 3 Sep, 2019
Finally finished reading one beginner notebbok kernel on Kaggle, which gave me some ideas about preprocessing. Also did some questions on Leetcode. I am so slow in coding, so I should do at least one question daily. (2 hr)

### R2D8: 2 Sep, 2019
Did some questions on LeetCode and learnt about implementing queue. I feel that I should spend time to study data structures and algorithm... (1.5 hr)

### R2D7: 1 Sep, 2019
Didn't have the mood for data science so I did some questions on LeetCode. (1 hr)

### R2D6: 31 Aug, 2019
I decided to put the cloud classification competition aside first, and try competitions without images first. Picked the "sale prediction" competition by the coursera course. 
Did some data exploration on the competition. I feel that I have forgotten many pandas skills
It is not trivial and involves time series. Titanic seems easier, but there are too many good kernels that I would like to learn later.
I hope to submit some results soon, to have a try on how submissions actually are.
It feels safe to follow the textbooks and courses, but I should be more used to explorations. (2 hr)

Competition I joined: [Predict Future Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/overview

### R2D5: 30 Aug, 2019
Completed Lessons 3-4 of Advanced SQL on Kaggle. Started looking at the Kaggle competition, but I am not sure how to start with. Tempted to go back on courses and textbooks, but I know I have taken enough courses and should gain more practical experience by exploring on my own. (1 hr)

### R2D4: 29 Aug, 2019
Completed Lessons 1-2 of Advanced SQL on Kaggle: JOIN and UNION, analytic functions (1 hr)

### R2D3: 28 Aug, 2019
Completed BigQuery ML Workshop on Kaggle. My first try of BigQuery on Google Cloud!  (1 hr)
