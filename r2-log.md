# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - CT

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [26 Aug, Monday, 2019].

## Log

### Plan 
1. SQL Tutorial & BigQuery ML Workshop on Kaggle
2. Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/understanding_cloud_organization
3. Personal website 

### R2D10: 4 Sep, 2019
Decided to spend time to learn basic data structures and algorithms, so I started about Binary Tree on Leetcode Explore. (2 hr)

### R2D9: 3 Sep, 2019
Finally finished reading one beginner notebbok kernel on Kaggle, which gave me some ideas about preprocessing. Also did some questions on Leetcode. I am so slow in coding, so I should do at least one question daily. (2 hr)

### R2D8: 2 Sep, 2019
Did some questions on LeetCode and learnt about implementing queue. I feel that I should spend time to study data structures and algorithm... (1.5 hr)

### R2D7: 1 Sep, 2019
Didn't have the mood for data science so I did some questions on LeetCode. (1 hr)

### R2D6: 31 Aug, 2019
I decided to put the cloud classification competition aside first, and try competitions without images first. Picked the "sale prediction" competition by the coursera course. 
Did some data exploration on the competition. I feel that I have forgotten many pandas skills
It is not trivial and involves time series. Titanic seems easier, but there are too many good kernels that I would like to learn later.
I hope to submit some results soon, to have a try on how submissions actually are.
It feels safe to follow the textbooks and courses, but I should be more used to explorations. (2 hr)

Competition I joined: [Predict Future Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/overview

### R2D5: 30 Aug, 2019
Completed Lessons 3-4 of Advanced SQL on Kaggle. Started looking at the Kaggle competition, but I am not sure how to start with. Tempted to go back on courses and textbooks, but I know I have taken enough courses and should gain more practical experience by exploring on my own. (1 hr)

### R2D4: 29 Aug, 2019
Completed Lessons 1-2 of Advanced SQL on Kaggle: JOIN and UNION, analytic functions (1 hr)

### R2D3: 28 Aug, 2019
Completed BigQuery ML Workshop on Kaggle. My first try of BigQuery on Google Cloud!  (1 hr)

### R2D2: 27 Aug, 2019
Lessons 5-6 of Intro to SQL on Kaggle (1 hr). Looking at BigQuery ML tutorial.
